DID - Defense in depth

Threat actors

Unskilled Attackers - individuals who want to perform attacks yet lack the technical knowledge to carry them out

Using easy to use tools that are freely available or can be purchased at a low cost to perform sophisticated attacks

Shadow IT - The process of bypassing corporate approval for technology purchases


The employee is often ethical but it often weakens security

Organized Crime - A threat actor whose motivation is usually financial

Insider threat - a person with intimate knowledge of a company's inner workings, motivation could be blackmail, revenge or financial, these attacks can be hard to recognize as they already often have clearance into administrative systems or have access to credentials.
Hacktivists - threat actors motivated by ideology or political motivations
Attacks are usually not financially motivated, often only hacking into websites with the intent of changing its contents as a statement or deleting information

Nation State Actors - Government sponsored hackers for launching attacks against other nations (infrastructure, military systems) often involved in multiyear campaigns targeting highly sensitive proprietary information

APT - a new class of attacks that use innovative tools that silently extract data over a long period of time

Brokers - similar to organized crime, the difference being 

Vulnerability - a weakness of a system ie the possibility of being attacked through a certain attack vector, or an update that breaks old code.

Zero day vulnerability - a vulnerability that is found by a threat actor before anyone knows ith exists - prevention includes air gapping your systems either through a restrictive firewall or by physically disconnection your systems to the public internet

Impact of attacks - A successful attack always results in several negative consequences, it may make the systems inaccessible, data can be destroyed, exfiltrated (leaked) deleted (purposefully) or utilized for identity theft.

Defending against attacks - Frameworks and regulations of data security, (NIST Framework) 

Regulations - Most organizations follow multiple data safety regulations, either industry standard regulations, or government mandated regulations, companies must follow these or they could face litigation from disgruntled users

Benchmarks/ secure config guides - distributed by hardware manufacturers and
